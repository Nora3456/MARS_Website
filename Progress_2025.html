        <p>
        The Astronaut AI Medical Support System project began on September 4, 2025, with the goal of creating a reliable artificial intelligence program that can assist astronauts with medical assessments during space missions. Over the past nine weeks, the team has made consistent progress in research, design, and development, focusing on both the scientific and technical aspects of astronaut health management.
        </p>

        <p>
        The project has progressed from team formation and goal-setting to active system development and user interface design. Through structured weekly objectives, the team collected and organized data, built and refined the AI model using the Google Gemini API, and prepared materials for the Preliminary Design Review (PDR). After completing the PDR, the team reviewed feedback and began planning for the Critical Design Review (CDR) scheduled for February.
        </p>

        <p>
        This report provides a detailed written account of the progress made each week, highlighting key accomplishments, challenges, and future goals as the project continues to move forward.

    <h2>Week 1 (September 4, 2025)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The first week focused on starting the project and organizing the team. Members came together to form the HUNCH AI Development Group and established the foundation for project planning. A detailed to-do list was created, outlining goals, deliverables, and system requirements needed for success. Initial discussions centered on defining what a reliable AI system would look like in a medical and aerospace context. The team also began researching credible sources and data types that would later be used to train the system effectively.</p>

    <h2>Week 2 (September 11, 2025)</h2>
    <br>
    <p> During the second week, the team began planning and structuring the data collection process. Members identified key information needed to simulate patient assessments, including questions related to symptoms, medical history, and other relevant factors. These plans were developed while maintaining strict ethical and procedural guidelines for data use. The team also created a comprehensive document that categorized potential medical emergencies astronauts could face during missions. This document organized conditions based on treatment urgency, from immediate life-threatening issues to long-term health risks. It also explained how space-specific factors such as microgravity, radiation, and isolation can intensify illnesses and complicate treatment.</p>

    <h2>Week 3 (September 18, 2025)</h2>
    <br>
    <p> In week three, the team continued refining its data collection process and began gathering verified medical information related to space-based conditions. Every source was carefully evaluated for accuracy and credibility. This week also marked the beginning of AI development. The team started building the system using the Google Gemini API, which provided access to reliable, verified data. These steps laid the groundwork for creating an AI capable of analyzing medical data and providing trustworthy recommendations.</p>

    <h2>Week 4 (September 25, 2025)</h2>
    <br>
    <p> Week four was dedicated to organization and planning. The team gathered all project materials, research findings, and requirements in a shared workspace to ensure easy access and consistency. During this time, the team reviewed environmental and technical challenges that might affect the system, such as limited computing capacity in spacecraft, microgravity effects, and user interface accessibility. The group also identified potential design risks and testing challenges that would need to be addressed later to ensure system reliability and usability.</p>

    <h2>Week 5 (October 2, 2025)</h2>
    <br>
    <p> The fifth week focused on preparing for the Preliminary Design Review. The team began creating visual materials, including brochures and a poster, that summarized project progress, research findings, and goals. These materials were designed to be visually appealing and informative to capture the attention of judges and reviewers. The team also continued refining the AI system to improve accuracy and functionality.</p>

    <h2>Week 6 (October 9, 2025)</h2>
    <br>
    <p> During week six, the team spent additional time improving the PDR materials. Brochures and posters were carefully reviewed to ensure that all important information was presented clearly and effectively. The team checked for any missing details and made sure the presentation accurately represented the scope and purpose of the project. The goal was to make the materials both informative and engaging for reviewers.</p>

    <h2>Week 7 (October 16, 2025)</h2>
    <br>
    <p> Preparation for the PDR presentation continued. Each team member developed specific talking points related to their area of expertise so that the group could present in a clear and organized manner. Assigning specific sections allowed everyone to speak confidently about their topic while ensuring that the presentation flowed smoothly and covered all aspects of the project.</p>

    <h2>Week 8 (October 23, 2025)</h2>
    <br>
    <p> After the PDR, the team met to review the feedback provided by judges and reviewers. This feedback helped identify areas where the project could be improved, particularly in user interface design and AI accuracy. In response, the team began researching design principles that would make the interface intuitive and easy to use. They also continued to fine-tune the AI system to improve reliability and precision.</p>

<section id="week9" class="week-section dark">
    <h2>Week 9 (October 30, 2025)</h2>
    <br>
    <p> In week nine, the team continued working on the user interface and refining the AI system. Early interface prototypes were created with a focus on clarity, simplicity, and functionality to ensure astronauts could use the system efficiently during missions. The AI model was also optimized to improve performance and adaptability in preparation for the upcoming Critical Design Review. Additionally, the team began exploring ways to add a memory feature to the AI system that would allow it to store and recall prior information while following ethical and legal standards for data privacy.
<br>
<br>
<b>Next Steps:</b>
<ul>• Continue to fine tune our AI system </ul>
<ul>• Focus on a few major illnesses in space</ul>
<ul>• Work on the user interface that way it is easy to understand </ul>
<ul>• Create a way for the users history to be saved and used by the AI system.</ul></p>

<section id="week11" class="week-section light">
    <h2>Week 11 (November 13, 2025)</h2>
    <br>
    <p> We have successfully fine tuned the gemini model and implemented it into the code (note that you must paste NEW api key into code AND DELETE AFTER USE, also please ask me before you test it) . We have also completed the memory problem regarding keeping documents like medical history stored as data. The program now asks first time users to upload medical history and sensor data. Data upload is optional and does not impact system performance, however it does impact results. We will continue working on the UI. Upon further review, we have decided to build them an alternate “offline” program that they can modify for their purposes. Check “Alternative Offline Model” for more information.</p>
    <br>
    <p> <b>Completed:</b>
        <br>
    <ul>• Fine tuned model (could always use improvement)</ul>
    <ul>• Memory system (Working condition, review further)</ul>
    <ul>• Work offline (Research)</ul>
    <ul>• Installing and starting to create a UI (UsingPySide6/Qt for python) for testing, to see how it works/learn more. </ul>
    <br>
        <br>
    <b>Next Steps:</b>
    <br>
    <ul>• Work on developing UI, and it’s preferred layout (simple, easy to access)</ul>
    <ul>• UI needs to include touch screen</ul>
    <ul>• Develop an alternate program that is less dependent on using live sources.</ul></p>
